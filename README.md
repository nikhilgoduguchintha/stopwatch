This is a stopwatch application which is built using vanila JavaScript.The start button allows you to begin the stopwatch, while the pause button allows you to pause it and resume from the same point later. The reset button allows you to reset the timer back to zero. Additionally, the timer display is updated in real-time as the stopwatch runs, so you can keep track of elapsed time easily.
